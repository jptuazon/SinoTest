Description: The Simulated Normality (or SiNo) Test is a Lilliefors-like 
    Kernel Density Estimate Test for Normality. It uses the integral of the 
    L1-distance over the reals as the test statistic. The null distribution 
    is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. The realized sample 
    is first standardized (z-score) and then, the kernel density estimate 
    is obtained based on the standardized sample. This kernel density 
    estimate is then compared with the standard normal density.
